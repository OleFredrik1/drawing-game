a plugin that simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nYou must be running webpack on node 0.12.x or higher\n\nInstall the plugin with npm:\n```shell\n$ npm install --save-dev html-webpack-harddisk-plugin\n```\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\nAdd the plugin to your webpack config as follows:\n\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new HtmlWebpackHarddiskPlugin()\n]  \n```\nThe above configuration will actually do nothing due to the configuration defaults.\n\nAs soon as you now set `alwaysWriteToDisk` to `true` the generated output of the HtmlWebpackPlugin will\nalways be written to disk. This is very useful if you want to pick up the output with another middleware.\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n\t\talwaysWriteToDisk: true\n\t}),\n  new HtmlWebpackHarddiskPlugin()\n]  \n```\n\nEven if you generate multiple files make sure that you add the HtmlWebpackHarddiskPlugin **only once**:\n\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n\t\talwaysWriteToDisk: true\n\t}),\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n\t\talwaysWriteToDisk: true,\n\t\tfilename: 'demo.html'\n\t}),\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n\t\talwaysWriteToDisk: false,\n\t\tfilename: 'test.html'\n\t}),\n  new HtmlWebpackHarddiskPlugin()\n]  \n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jantimon","email":"j.nicklas@me.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-04-19T07:21:41.473Z","created":"2016-04-18T11:44:47.862Z","0.0.1":"2016-04-18T11:44:47.862Z","0.0.2":"2016-04-19T07:21:41.473Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin","keywords":["webpack","plugin","html-webpack-plugin","disk","template"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"Jan Nicklas","email":"j.nicklas@me.com","url":"https://github.com/jantimon"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"CPDI4W2QQ4VW6B5UXA16FM8AM\""}
